# stocks_analysis

## Overview

In this project we leverage the power of VBA to analyze a sizable set of stock data from 2017 and 2018. With these tools we can easily calculate and present in digestible fashion key stats about the stocks in question.

## Results

The analysis clearly shows that the stocks we examined performed on the whole much better in 2017, when all but one were positive, than in 2018, when all but two were down year over year. The stock of particular interest to us, DQ saw a dramatic swing from a 199% increase in 2017 to a drop of 67% the following year.

## Summary

By using advanced methods we were able to make the data more accessible and to increase the efficiency of our code, significantly reducing run time.
